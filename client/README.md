# auth-app

MERN stack SaaS application. NOTE: If you submit your credit card info you will be charged 5$ it is fully functional!

## Installation

To work on this project you must have node configured.

Traverse to the project directory...

```
npm i && cd client && npm i
```

Once you have installed the necessary packages...

```
cd .. && npm run dev
```

## Usage

With this application, you can login with a custom RESTful API that I created and security that I have implemented.

Once you are logged in you have access to the private-route dashboard, where I have implemented the Stripe APi to handle payments. Clicking on the payment link will allow you to pay me $5.00. Thanks in advance!
